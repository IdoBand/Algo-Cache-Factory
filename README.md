This is a small project that shows the implementation of <h4>**Factory design pattern**</h4> as well as implementation of various <h4>**cache algorithms**</h4> such as LRU, Random, and FIFO.

Along this project I'll use suitable data structures and OOP approach so that it will be as efficient as possible.

The purpose of this small project is to practice design patterns, OOP and some data structures as well as maybe to be used in a bigger project in the future, partially or as a whole.
